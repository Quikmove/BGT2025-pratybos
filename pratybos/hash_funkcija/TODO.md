# TO DO
- [ ] Implement benchmarking tests for konstitucija.txt: check hash time with 1,2,4,8,...,n-th line of this file; test few times and take an average;draw a graph with how input size correlates with hash time
- [ ] Figure out what tests are needed
- [ ] Generate all needed tests
- [ ] Implement running tests from generated files
- [ ] lastly: add a comparison against a traditional hashing algo like MD5/SHA-1/SHA-256
